            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Of Snakes and Ladders, and Dance</h1><p>There was a time when kids used to spend their free time playing board games. Sometimes it was a whole family affair; at other times it was when friends came over on a lazy Sunday afternoon. It even used to be part of one’s repertoire of packed time-fillers when the family traveled. Games ranged from the four-cornered Ludo (didn’t everyone have their own favourite colours to start from?) to the strategic Battleship (particularly enjoyed the battery-operated version, complete with missile launch and explosion sounds) to the whodunits like Cluedo, and the empire-building Monopoly. I must say that the most complex board game I have ever played (once) was Poleconomy, a Monopoly-like game that swapped companies for properties and had a parallel political and capitalist actions. There was one particular game though which more often than not introduced kids to the whole concept of board games; it was none other thanSnake and Ladders.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/1ccd6bf6ed4c77d697faacf33db02b5dd5c2e43a.png"></article>]]></description>
